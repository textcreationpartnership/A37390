            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Becauſe that which is made, muſt be made by ſomething, for as I ſayed before, nothing can do nothing: but Adam before he was made, was nothing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could not make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. And the ſame reaſon doth shew that the firſt of euery thinde of all creatures in the world, and the world it ſelfe, did not make themſelues, but were all made by a thing, which was ſomething be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; that is by God allmighty.</p>

Beſides, nature it ſelfe doth teach vs that the maker of all thinges is God; for in all our dangers and misfortunes we do naturally call vpon him who made vs: and ſo all ſortes of people are agreed that he is God. Moreouer the beauty of this created world, doth teach vs as much: for as when we ſee a faire houſe well built, we iudge that it was made by ſome excellent architect, ſo
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63100:6"/> when we ſee the beauty of this world, the order of creatures, the variety of times and ſeaſons, we gather from thence the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and wiſedome of him who made it; and that he can be no other but God.</p>

Againe, ſeeing that nothing can be done, but what is done by ſomething, and whatſoeuer is ſomething, is made by God to be ſomething, it followeth that God doth giue power to do all thinges that are
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63100:7"/> done, or can be done, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that he him ſelfe can doe whatſoeuer can be done; for cleare it is, that who giueth power to doe any thing, hath in himſelfe power to doe the ſame, ſince that nothing can giue, what it hath not it ſelfe. And ſo you ſee that God is allmighty: for that thing is allmighty, which can make all thinges, and doe all thinges. And for this reaſon alſo we muſt grant, that God hath in himſelfe the perfections of all thinges.</p>

And ſo it is cleare that God is the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63100:8"/> Author of all our actions, by giuing them exiſtence, as well as of our being: as the Architect, who by ouerſeeing the building, hath influence into euery-parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular of a houſe, doth build the houſe more truly, then the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, by whoſe meanes thoſe thinges are executed, which he or daineth about it.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63100:11"/> And the reaſon of it is, becauſe, he who is abſolutely ſoueraine, cannot haue any thing diſtinct from himſelfe as a companion equall to himſelfe; for abſolute ſouerainty doth ſignify a ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity aboue all: now God, who hath all perfections, muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly haue ſouerainty; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he would want that perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is the chiefe of all.

                  <p>You may eaſily conceiue this, if you know how children come to be like to their fathers. You muſt conſider then, that Adam his bodie (being deſigned by God for a ſoule endowed with origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Iuſtice) was fitted for the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of ſuch a ſoule; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, it was imbued with all ſuch ſpeciall diſpoſitions, as were requiſite to make it pliable, and ſubiect to reaſon. Now Adam procreating his ſonns bodie with the ſame good diſpoſitions, which his owne body had; and allmigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God (who had promiſed by couenant the grace of innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to all his poſteritie, in caſe that he himſelfe did continue in his due obedience) finding thoſe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63100:29"/> good diſpoſitions in the childs bodie, as an infallible token of his fathers actuall perſeuerance in his firſt grace, he could not faile to endow, according to his promiſe, the ſoule of Adams ſonne with the ſame grace of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall iuſtice, which his father had. And ſo, ſeeing that theſe good diſpoſitions in the childs body (which were antecedent to the creation of the ſoule, and proceeded from the like diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in its parents) would haue been as a ſeale of God his coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with mankinde; it followeth that they would haue drawne by a neceſſary co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence, in vertue of the ſayd couenant, originall iuſtice, euen in to the childe his ſoule. And ſo you ſee, how this firſt grace was to come to vs from our parents by our generation. And it was moſt conformable to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:63100:30"/> reaſon, that it should come that way: for, as on the one ſide it was naturall, that Adam should haue made his ſonnes bodie like his owne, and conſequently diſpoſed in a ſpeciall manner to be ſubiect to reaſon; ſo it was moſt reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that Allmighty God should fitt the ſoule to the ſonnes bodie; which would not haue been, vnleſſe he had giuen him a ſoule apt to loue God aboue all thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges; ſeeing that the actuall ſubiection of the bodie to reaſon, doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from ſuch a diſpoſition in the ſoule.

                  <p>Eue was induced principally by pride and vanitie; for the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell (who was become à Diuell by pride) did infect Eue with the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:63100:31"/> ſame ſinne, that thereby he might make her and Adam companions of his miſerie, perſwading her, that if she did rebell againſt God by eating the fruit, which he had forbidden them; they should become greater then they were. And although this was the chiefe motiue, yet two other motiues did alſo concurre: for, by the ſame act she yeilded to three ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſuggeſtions, all which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſett downe in ſcripture.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:63100:31"/> loath to diſpleaſe her. And ſo that which induced Adam to ſinne, was a diſordinate affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> towards Eue, chooſing to offend God, rather then to contriſtate her.</p>

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:63100:32"/> with ſinne, anie other but ſinners. For Adam his firſt ſinne did not infect him, only as a particular perſon, but alſo as the generall roote of all mankinde.</p>

               <div n="7" type="question">
                  <head>7. Are we all then borne in ſinne?</head>
                  <p>Yes; for as thoſe who were borne of Adam and Eue, were borne ſinners by the infection of their Parents, ſo were their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren likewiſe for the ſame reaſon borne in ſinne, and the children of their children; and ſo it muſt needs be for all their poſteritie to the worlds end. And the reaſon of this is, becauſe Adam, falling from the loue of God, to loue himſelfe more then God (which loue was contrarie to reaſon) this change in his ſoule could not chooſe but worke a great change in his verie bodie, and deſtroye its former good diſpoſitions, that were fitted to the grace of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:63100:33"/> by moulding in it others of a contrarie bias. For we ſee by experience, that our ſoules ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations haue ſtrong effects in our bodies; we ſee that when we heare good newes, the ioy in our ſoules maketh our very bodies light and iocond: and when we grieue, the griefe of our ſoules redoundeth to our bodies, and maketh them dull and heauy. Now then, Adam being changed, not only in his ſoule, but alſo in his very bodie; he could not make his ſonnes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die with a better diſpoſition, then his owne bodie had; which was not now diſpoſed to be ſubiect to reaſon, but the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie: for the ſoule by louing an other thing better then God, carried the bodie along with it, and put it into poſſeſſion of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand againſt reaſon; and ſo it remained in rebellion with its
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:63100:33"/> proper motion independent of reaſon: which bad diſpoſition, being deriued alſo to the childs bodie, and being there as a marke of that tranſgreſſion, which we did all of vs incurre by Adam, it re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth the ſame bodie, through a neceſſarie conſequence (by reaſon of Gods couenant with Adam) vncapable of anie other ſoule, but ſuch as is guilty of that loſſe, which was inflicted by God vpon Adam, and vpon all his poſterity, in caſe that he did breake his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement. From whence it followeth, that no other ſoule could be due to ſuch a bodie, as Adam made to his ſonne, but ſuch as was depriued of originall iuſtice. And this is that, which Chriſtians call origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne, to witt the miſſing of grace, or originall iuſtice, in the child, as proceeding from the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:63100:34"/> guilt, which we contracted through the fault of our firſt father, in whom we all ſinned. So that the want, or priuation, is particular to euery one, the cauſe or actuall ſinne only in Adam.</p>

                  <p>No: for this ſecond loue, being preuented with diſpoſitions in man contrarie to it ſelfe, it could not (according to the ordinarie courſe of God his prouidence) produce that effect, which the firſt loue did, that found no ſuch contratie diſpoſitions, but all thinges fitted to it ſelfe. Nether can it on the ſuddaine extirpate thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but with a great deale of paine and labour, and

And ſo allmighty God hath moſt iuſtly ordained, that theſe ill inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, cauſed by this inordinate loue, should alwayſe remaine in mankinde, as due punishment for his firſt ſinne. And this is that which is called concupiſcence; which is an inclination, that draweth our harts to loue our ſelues more then God, contrarie to the former good diſpoſition, that was in man, by the grace of innocencie. And no wonder, if ſince the ſoule cannot be without loue, and hauing loſt the loue of God, it runneth after ſenſe, and loueth thoſe thinges which ſenſe propoſeth, ſeeing that ſenſe is the

                  <p>Becauſe, by naturall knowledge, we cannot come to know the meanes, which are preſcribed for our ſaluation; and therefore we haue need of a ſupernaturall helpe, which is fayth: and ſo the Apoſtle telleth vs, that without

               <div n="2" type="question">
                  <head>2. What then is fayth?</head>
                  <p>Fayth is a gift of God, and a light, whereby we do firmely and without doubting, belieue all that, which is propoſed to vs by the Catholike church, to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued, not becauſe we ſee it, but becauſe it is reuealed by God, who cannot ſpeake vntruthes. So that, to an act of fayth neceſſary for ſaluation, two thinges are required, firſt, in regard of God, that it be an obiect reuealed by him, and propoſed to vs by the Church as ſuch: ſecondly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of man, that he giue a firme aſſent to it.</p>

                  <p>No more is required to an inward act of fayth; yet to practiſe this vertue perfectly, we
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:63100:60"/> are ſome times obliged to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare our beliefe by an outward act, when occaſion requireth it: for man being compoſed of body and ſoule, he ought to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God his veracitie, by both theſe partes; by his ſoule, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing; and by his body, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing with his mouth what he belieueth. And therefore it is neuer lawfull to diſſemble our fayth, by profeſſing one thing, and belieuing an other; for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer denyeth Ieſus Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, will be denyed by him before his father.</p>

                  <p>Becauſe (as I haue obſerued before) we cannot haue Catholike fayth, but by the inſtruction of the church, which propoſeth to vs thoſe truthes, which God did reueale to his Apoſtles and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to the end that they should communicate them to others, who were to ſucceed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in the church, and they againe to others, and ſo till the end of the world.</p>

                  <p>They are the Bishops, and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of the Catholike Church, whom the Apoſtles, and Diſciples left behind them to teach vs that doctrine, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues had taught, and preached before to the whole world. And therefore we are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to belieue what the Bishops, and Paſtours of the Catholike Church teach; becauſe we are ſure, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church deliuereth to vs; that ſame doctrine, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles deliuered to her.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="8" type="question">
                  <head>8. How are we ſure of this?</head>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe our Sauiour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe doth aſſure vs ſo; for he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs, that the gates of hell, shall not preuaile againſt his Church; ſo that the Church is the ſupreme and certaine guide, to which Chriſt directeth vs, for
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:63100:61"/> the knowledge of the true faith, and true religion. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (abſtracting from ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall meanes) reaſon it ſelfe doth conuince as much; for the Church being vniuerſall, that is, a Congregation of Chriſtians diſperſed through the whole world, it followeth, that she can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not propoſe a falſehood; ſeeing that the Chriſtians diſperſed in ſo many countries, as are neceſſary to make vniuerſality, cannot meete together, and agree to frame a lye: and therefore if they conſent together, that ſuch a thing was deliuered vnto them, for the doctrine of Chriſt, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chooſe but be ſo. And this is that, which Diuines call Traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which deſcendeth from father to ſonne in all nations, where the Catholike fayth is profeſſed; and when it is contradicted or called
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:63100:62"/> in to doubt, the queſtion is deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a generall Councel, which is a congregation of Catholike Bishops and Doctours gathered together out of all partes where the Church is diſperſed. And to this, (I meane to vniuerſall tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) no hereſy layeth clayme: and yet Religion is ſo grounded vpon it, that euen all Heretikes muſt acknowledge this ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, for the receauing of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So that we ſee how the vniuerſality of the Church, is, euen in grounds of nature, and abſtracting from all ſupernaturall aduantages, as great a warrant as can be, that what the Church teacheth, is that ſame, which the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt, diſperſed through the whole world, had taught before. Laſtly, we are ſure, that what the Church ſayeth is true, not only becauſe
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:63100:62"/> she is vniuerſall, but alſo becauſe she is inueſted with all the other motiues, that are apt to beget beliefe, as ſantity; vnity, antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty &amp;c. and ſo she is credible of herſelfe, in whatſoeuer she affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth.</p>

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:63100:90"/> we are to pronounce it with a ſincere confidence and affection, ſuch as true children do beare towards their father. Secondly that we ought to ſay it with a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall intention, and charity, towards all our brothren vnited in one body of the Church; for we do not ſay, <hi>my father,</hi> but <hi>our father.</hi> Thirdly that we ought to addreſſe our ſelues to him, as to our heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly father, and ſo to ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke nothing but heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly thinges, or what conduceth thereunto.</p>

                  <p>It is addreſſed particularly to the firſt perſon of the bleſſed Trinity; becauſe it was compoſed by Ieſus Chriſt, who is the ſecond perſon himſelfe, the only ſonne of his father, and our mediatour towards his father: yet this doth not hinder, but that it is addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed alſo to all the three perſones

                  <head>5. Why is God, and particularly the firſt perſon of the bleſſed Trinity, called our father?</head>
                  <p>Becauſe he hath created vs, and doth nourish, and conſerue vs: but chiefly, becauſe he doth loue and embrace vs, with a fatherly loue; whereby we are truly his adopted children: for no body would giue his owne ſonne, to ranſome others, if he did not eſteeme thoſe others alſo, as if they were his owne children.</p>

               <div n="6" type="question">

                  <p>Although he be euery where, yet he is ſayed particularly to be in heauen, becauſe he is ſeen there perfectly by the bleſſed, and ſo our hope is at laſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished there. In the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as we may ſay, that a mans ſoule is ſeated in his head, though

                  <head>7. Declare the firſt petition; Hallowed be thy name.</head>
                  <p>In the firſt petition we demand, that God be known of all the world, and that ſo his holy name be honoured, and glorifyed by all, as it becommeth him, who is infinitely holy in himſelfe, and who is our Creatour, our laſt end, and our ſoueraine good.</p>

                  <p>Becauſe euery thing is known by its name; and by this petition, we demand, that God be known to the whole world, and all ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and falſe religion deſtroyed. And ſo it is worthyly placed in the firſt place, both becauſe all
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:63100:91"/> the euills in the world proceed from not knowing God; and alſo becauſe no body can pray to him, vnleſſe they firſt know him; and therefore this knowledge is the firſt thing, to be demanded for thoſe who want it; and laſtly to teach vs, that the firſt thing, which a Chriſtian ought to ſeeke, is the glorie of God: for although our owne intereſt cannot be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the glorie of God, becauſe it is impoſſible to ſeeke God his glory, without ſauing ourſelues, or ſaue ourſelues without glorifying God; yet theſe two ends ought to be one ſubordinate to the other, and the glorie of God to be preferred before our owne proper intereſt. And for this reaſon alſo we ſay, in the two following petitions, <hi>thy kingdome come,</hi> and, <hi>thy will be done,</hi> to shew that we ought
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:63100:92"/> to ſeeke our owne good, chiefely with relation to his glory.</p>

                     <p>It is a worship, which Diuines call <hi>Latria,</hi> becauſe it is the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine worship of all, and it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in this, that it is an act, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we teſtifie, that God is our ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and ſoueraine Lord, from whoſe goodneſſe, and power, we haue both our being, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation.

                     <p>Two thinges are abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for ſaluation, touching the obſeruance of this precept, for thoſe who are come to the vſe of reaſon. The firſt is, that the loue of God be the moſt abſolute,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:63100:114"/> the moſt affectionate, the moſt generall, and predominant ouer all our other louer, and that it raigne ouer all our paſſions: ſo that we muſt loue God not only more then our owne liues; but alſo we muſt loue him generally and without exception, more then all that, which we deſire, or can deſire. For we muſt be truly and ſincerely ſo diſpoſed in the bottome of our harts, as to looſe all thinges that are moſt deare vnto vs, and to ſuffer the greateſt indignities that can be, rather then to looſe him; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently rather then to commit the leaſt mortall ſinne. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the loue of God is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſarie to ſaluation for all men in the world; and this degree is ſufficient, ſuppoſing it be accompanied with a ſecond condition, which is, that hauing
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:63100:115"/> once this loue rooted in vs, we endeauour ſtill to encreaſe it more and more, by our prayers, by our good workes, and by a deuoute rule of our whole life: for let vs haue made neuer ſo great aduancement in charity, we are ſtill bound to go on, and not to make a ſtand; becauſe we haue not yet attained to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect accomplishment of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of louing God with all our ſoule; nether shall we attaine vnto it, vntill we come to heauen; and therefore not to go on, is to go back.</p>
                     <p>Now ſeeing that the loue of God muſt be predominant ouer all our affections, and raigne ouer all our paſſions, the ſecureſt rule to know, whether we haue truly this loue of God or no, is to looke into the courſe of our life, our actions, and deſignes. For as we
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:63100:115"/> ſee amongſt worldly men, that ordinarily in euery one, ſome one paſſion is predominant ouer all the others, which maketh, that we eſteeme ſome auaricious, others ambitious, others vaine glorious, others addicted to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, others reuengefull; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly as the loue of riches, or of greatneſſe, or of glorie, or pleaſure, or reuenge do raigne in them; whereof we do iudge by their actions, deſignes, occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and by the whole conduct of their life, which is for the moſt part tainted by that principall affection that raigneth in them. In the like manner, no man hath reaſon to think that he loueth God aboue all thinges, which is neceſſary to ſaluation, if exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his life, actions, employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, deſires, and pretenſions, he doth not finde, that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:63100:116"/> part of them do tend towards God, ſeeing that the loue which we owe to him, is not a loue of wordes and thoughts, but of effects and actions. And therefore we muſt not deceaue ourſelues, taking the acts of our vnderſtanding, for acts of loue and affection; for there is no man, that hath the vſe of reaſon, whoſe vnderſtanding doth not tell him, taht we ought to loue God more then ourſelues; yea, there is no true man, who hath not an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to loue God, more then himſelfe: but the loue of God doth not conſiſt in that act of the vnderſtanding, nor in this inclination, but it conſiſteth in putting this inclination in practiſe.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, thoſe who do mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure againſt their ſuperiours, either ciuill, or eccleſiaſticall; and do cenſure their ordinances, and manner of gouernment; which murmuring is for the moſt part an occaſion of great harme: for ſuch diſcourſes do eaſilie beget
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:63100:128"/> in the harts of the hearers, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of their perſons and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which afterwards doth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe infect the people; and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth contempt, diſobedience, and diſorder in the Common wealth.</p>

And on the contrary ſide the Churchmen, who haue care of ſoules, offend greiuouſly, if they do not admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Sacraments, and preach the word of God, to thoſe who are vnder their care, and giue them ſpirituall inſtruction, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and comfort. As alſo, if they do not giue almes to the poore, as farre as they are able, eſpecially to ſuch as are vnder their care.</p>
                     <p>Wiues offend againſt this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:63100:129"/> who do neglect, or diſdaine their huſbands; or do giue them an occaſion of choler, and doe not ſeeke to content them in all reaſonable thinges. As contrarywiſe, huſbands do abuſe their authoritie, which God hath giuen them ouer their wiues, if they depriue them of honeſt liberty; if they do not allow them commodities neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for their entertainment; if they treate them outragiouſly in words or deedes; if without their conſent they liue continually abſent from them, vpon any diſguſt, or without a iuſt cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Pupills are bound to follow the counſell, and aduiſe of their tutors. And tutors offend if they take not care to inſtruct their pupills; if they permit their goods to be diſſipated through their negligence; if they marry
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:63100:129"/> them diſaduantageouſly, either through fauour, of for other reſpects.</p>
                     <p>Seruants offend by neglecting their ſeruice; by murmuring againſt their Maſters; by ſpeaking to their diſaduantage; by giuing them an occaſion of choler; by diſpoſing of their goods without their conſent, &amp;c. Maſters offend by too much rigour towards their ſeruants; in exacting from them more then they are able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme; in not procuring their good, as much as they can conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently; in reteining their wages from them, that ſo they may be conſtrained to liue with them; as alſo in hindering them from marrying, or diſſwading them from any other courſe, that may be notably diſaduantageous to them, to the end that they may thereby ſtill haue them for their ſeruants.</p>

                     <p>The ſeuerall kindes of theft do proceed, either from the nature of the goods, which are taken, or from the places whence they are taken, or from the ſeuerall manner of taking or vſurping them. For to take a ſacred thing, is ſacriledge; as alſo to take that, which is not ſacred, if it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to a ſacred place to be kept there, as in a ſafegarde, or if it be taken from a ſacred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is ſacriledge. In like manner, to take a thing ſecretly, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called theft; but to take it openly, or by violence, is rapine. And the ſinne is ſo much the greater, or leſſe, as the preiudice, which is done, is greater or leſſe: and ſo it is a mortall ſinne, when the thing that is taken, is of a conſiderable value in it ſelfe, or

                  <p>No; for although they be not abſolutely good, yet they are not naught, becauſe they haue in themſelues a kinde of good: for as in a faire picture, garden, or houſe, or any ſuch thing made by art, there is left in them from the Artiſt an impreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of reaſon, that makes them delightſome, and conformable to our nature; ſo alſo is there an impreſſion of reaſon called <hi>decorum,</hi> or <hi>honeſtas,</hi> in morall actions, which giueth content both to the doer, and ſpectatour, and enticeth morall men to do ſuch actions, as being conformable to mans nature.

                  <p>Beſides, theſe ſeuen vices are alſo called the ſeuen deadly ſinnes; becauſe, whereas all the vicious affections of man, are reduced to
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:63100:185"/> theſe ſeuen heades, if it chance, that the obiect of any one of them, be more predominant ouer our affection, then the loue of God, it putteth vs into a ſtate of habituall mortall ſinne, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priueth vs of God his grace. And although peraduenture ſuch a man may notwithſtanding, by reaſon of his naturall inclination, or of ſome other more powerfull, worldly intereſt, forbeare to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thoſe groſſe, and palpable ſinnes, which ſuch vicious affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do vſualy draw men into; yet this will not excuſe him. As for example, a couetous man, who for feare of the temporall lawes, or for feare of looſing his reputation, or for other worldly reſpects, doth not commit vſury, nor robbe, or ſteale from his neighbour, will not be ſaued, if his heart be ſo ſet vpon riches,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:63100:185"/> as to be wholy occupied in ſeeking, and laying vp worldly wealth; but this man is of the number of thoſe, whom S. Paul declareth to be excluded from the kingdome of heauen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, although he do not ſteale, nor coozen his neighbour, yet he is truly couetous. And the ſame is to be ſayd of thoſe, who ſet their thoughts, and endeauours wholy vpon honours, vanities, pleaſures, feaſting, gaming, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, factions, and the like, placing wholy their delight in them: for though the particular actions of theſe men, conſidered ſingly by themſelues, may ſeeme veniall, yet the whole number becometh damnable; becauſe it doth argue, that their affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are placed in thoſe obiects, as in their laſt end, and ſo they tranſgreſſe the firſt precept. For how can we
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:63100:186"/> iudge of our affections, but by our actions? And if theſe obiect take vp our whole employment, is it not euident, that they are predominant ouer our affections; and that it is not God, but they, that reigne in vs, as the laſt and principall end we aime at? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, reflecting vpon our ſelues, if we finde that our life, actions and deſignes, are bent in the bottome of our hart, only vpon worldly thinges, and that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God, and the ſaluation of our ſoule, is leaſt in our thoughts, and the moſt neglected of all our occupations, certainly we do groſſely deceiue ourſelues, if, this notwithſtanding, we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that we do loue God aboue all thinges, or that the loue of him is the moſt cordiall loue of all our loues, (as, if we will be ſaued, it muſt be, according
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:63100:186"/> to that which hath been ſayd Leſſ. 17. Num. 23.) becauſe our vnderſtanding doth tell vs, it muſt be ſo. For this appretiation of loue, by which we are bound to preferre God aboue all thinges, doth not conſiſt in diſcourſe, but in affection; and the rule, or marke of our affection, is not our vnderſtanding, but (as I ſayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) our actions; for the very damned themſelues, do know by their vnderſtanding, as well as we, that God is the laſt end, they ought to adhere vnto.</p>

                  <p>The Councell of Florence teacheth vs, that the Sacraments of the old law, were only figures of grace to be giuen by Chriſts paſſion, but they did not cauſe grace; whereas the Sacraments of the new law, according to the doctrine of the ſame Councell, do both containe grace, and alſo cauſe it in thoſe, who receiue them worthily. Wherefore you are to vnderſtand, that as God Allmighty brought the Iewes to loue him, by temporall promiſes, and rewards, that he might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards giue them celeſtiall ones; ſo their Sacraments made them capable only of temporall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, as Circumciſion made the Iew to be one, who had part in the land of promiſe: their puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications

Secondly, to get ſtrength, and greatneſſe, to be able to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarieties, as would deſtroy life. Thirdly, to be nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished, whereby life is conſerued, whilſt we performe the actions, for which it was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. Fourthly, we haue need of phyſicke, in caſe we be ſicke. And fifthly of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable diet, to recouer ſtrength after ſickneſſe. Sixthly, of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, in caſe of danger to be infected. And laſtly, of procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to giue life vnto others, to ſucceed in place of thoſe, who dye, that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kinde may not wholy perish. So alſo in our ſpirituall life, we are borne by Baptiſme; and ſo are made members of Chriſt his familie: we are ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, and get growth by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation: we are nourished by
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:63100:191"/> the holy Euchariſt: we are cured of ſickneſſe by Pennance: we are freed from the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guishing, which remaineth after ſickneſſe, by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme vnction: we are preſerued from infection, by Matrimonie, which belongeth properly to married perſons, becauſe their ſtate of life, is expoſed to moſt eminent dangers of the world, and the flesh. By Matrimonie alſo the Church is ſtill ſupplyed with a new carnall progenie, into which the true worship of God, may be introduced, and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated. And laſtly, by Order, we are prouided of ſpirituall fathers, who are to multiply ſpiritually new iſſue, by propagating the fayth, and making new Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.

                  <p>Yes; for as it is defined in the councell of Trent, the leaſt part of euery hoſte, and the leaſt part of the conſecrated wine doth containe all the flesh, and bloud, the bodie, and the ſoule, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie, and diuinitie of Ieſus Chriſt. And the reaſon of this is,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:63100:205"/> becauſe Chriſt his bodie is brought into the viſible element, in lieu of the ſubſtance of bread, and therefore it muſt be in euery part of the element, where it was bread before: wherefore, ſeeing that when bread is cut into ten, twenty, or into as many pieces as you will, euery piece is bread; it doth follow alſo, that the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated element, being cut into as many pieces, euery piece muſt be Chriſt his bodie; for otherwiſe, Chriſt his bodie would not be in euery part, where bread was: for a legge only, or an arme, is not Chriſt his bodie, no more then one wheele of a clock, is a clock.

                  <p>No; for as his being whole in euery part, (which is done by being depriued of locall exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) maketh his body, that it cannot be deuided; ſo it doth alſo make it, that it cannot receiue any corporall action, or impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for there can be no corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall impreſſion, where there is no locall extenſion.

                  <p>Becauſe, the holy Euchariſt is of the number of thoſe Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which were inſtituted, not

And the reaſon of this is, becauſe, to be in the ſtate of grace, is to be in charity with God, and our neighbour, which is a thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for communion, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the nature of this Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: for Chriſt inuiteth vs in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to a banquet; but none vſe to be inuited to banquets, but ſuch as are his friends, who maketh the banquet, and alſo friends to one an other, for feare of turning mirth, and loue, for which banquets were inſtituted, into ſorrow, and contention.

                     <p>It is deuided into two generall ſortes, the one is perfect, which
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:63100:214"/> is abſolutely called Contrition, the other is imperfect, which is vſually called Attrition. Which difference ariſeth from the ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall degrees of conuerting our ſelues to God; for ſometimes our conuerſion may be ſo perfect, as to make vs not only forbeare our former ſinfull actions, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance in vnlawfull obiects, but alſo to deteſt them more then hell it ſelfe; whereby through the powerfull working of God his grace in our hearts, our affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards God becometh greater, then the loue of our ſelues, and is more firmely rooted in vs, then the loue of any vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full obiect: ſo that if it pleaſe God to preſerue vs in this diſpoſition, we do eaſily afterwards ouercome any temptation, be it neuer ſo great. Sometimes againe our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion may be ſo weake, as that
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:63100:215"/> although it be able to make vs forbeare, and deteſt ſinne for the preſent, becauſe it is greater then our preſent adheſion to any vnlawfull obiect, yet it ſettleth not in vs the loue of God ſo ſtrongly, as our former ſinfull affections had ſettled the loue of our ſelues, and ſo it is not ſo firmely rooted in vs, as our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſenſuall inclinations are; and therefore we are afterwards eaſily ouercome againe by new tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And this is ordinarily the condition of penitent Chriſtians in the beginning, who do often riſe by God his grace, and yet fall againe by their owne weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, vntill by pennance (that is by workes of mortification, which are the worthy fruites of repentance) and by often recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Sacraments, their incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to loue God aboue all
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:63100:215"/> thinges becometh greater, and more firmely rooted in them, then their ſinfull inclination to ſelfe loue. Now the deteſtation of ſinne ariſing from the former perfect conuerſion, is called Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition; the other, Attritio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which is a metaphore taken from any hard thing bruzed by a harder, for if you only grate it againſt the harder, you may bring it into what fashion you liſt, but it will ſtill remaine hard at the middle; but if you do not only grate it, but beate it in a morter, you will turne it all into duſt.</p>

                     <head>12. What is the motiue of perfect Contrition?</head>
                     <p>It can be no other but the pure loue of God for his owne ſake only, proceeding from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his goodneſſe, and of the obligation we haue by reaſon of it, to ſerue him, and not
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:63100:216"/> to offend him. And when I ſay, it can be no other but the pure loue of God, I do not intend to affirme, that it cannot be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with other pious affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as the feare of hell, the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God his iudgements, the deſire of heauen, and the like; which are not only conſiſtent with the pure loue of God, but alſo good diſpoſitions to procure it, and conſerue it; for ſuch is the condition of humane infirmity, as that the inferiour ſtepps by which we ariue to perfection, are oftentimes neceſſary to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vs in it. But that which I intend to ſay, is, that the pure loue of God for his owne ſake only, without regard to our owne proper intereſt, muſt be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall motiue, and immediate ground of contrition, becauſe no other motiue but God himſelfe,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:63100:216"/> as he is our laſt end, can conuert vs wholy to God, and make vs deteſt ſinne more then hell it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Now this perfect contrition, and pure loue of God hath, diuers degrees, for ſometimes it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth purely and ſimply out of the conſideration of God in himſelfe, without relation to his creatures; who by reaſon of his owne infinite perfections, and infinite goodneſſe, deſerueth to be beloued aboue all thinges, all loue being due to him meerely for that goodneſſe, which is in himſelfe; and this is the higheſt motiue of diuine loue. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times this pure loue proceedeth from the conſideration of God his goodneſſe towards his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, expreſſed in his benefits beſtowed on them, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the benefits of creation,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:63100:217"/> redemption, and euerlaſting ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation propoſed to all, who do not through their owne faults depriue themſelues of it. Now the conſideration of God his infinite loue expreſſed towards vs by theſe benefits, doth moue vs in gratitude to loue him againe: which reciprocall loue of ours, when it cometh to that height of gratitude, as to loue him againe not for our owne intereſt, but for his owne ſake only; and ſo, to auoid ſinne, and to do good, meerely becauſe it is gratefull to him, that is, becauſe he would haue vs to do ſo; it is alſo a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient motiue for true contrition, though not ſo perfect as the former.</p>
                     <p>Againe, this perfect contrition hath diuers degrees, not only by reaſon of the motiues on which it is grounded, but alſo by reaſon
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:63100:217"/> of the effects it produceth in vs; for although this loue of God aboue all thinges, when it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth true contrition, be alwayes ſtronger and more intenſe in vs, then the loue of ourſelues, or then the loue of our owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, euen in the ioyes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, if they could be ſeparated from God; and conſequently doth make vs to deteſt ſinne, more then hell it ſelfe (without which it would not be an act of true contrition;) yet it is not alwayes ſo perfect, as not to leaue in vs ſome little affection to worldly thinges, and ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes of our former inclinations, acquired by euill habites. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times againe it is ſo perfect, as that it tranſporteth our affection from all created thinges what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, and ſettleth it wholy vpon God, ſo that we do not loue any
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:63100:218"/> thing but with relation to him, whereby we cannot thinke of any vnlawfull obiect, but hate it, (ſuch as we may ſuppoſe to haue been in S. Paul, and S. Marie Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene at the firſt inſtant of their conuerſion;) and ſo it extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth by the very roote, our euill inclinations formerly acquired by peruerſe habits. And this is that eminent degree of contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which doth not only cleanſe vs from the guilt of ſinne, but alſo freeth vs from the paines due to our ſinne in Purgatorie.</p>

                     <head>13. What is the motiue of Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or imperfect Contrition?</head>
                     <p>Sometimes it may be the pure loue of God only, proceeding from the conſideration of his goodneſſe, but not working ſo ſtrongly in vs, as that perfect loue, which we haue ſayd to be the ground of Contrition, becauſe
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:63100:218"/> it is not yet ſo ſtrong in vs, as our inclination to ſelfe loue. For although we may be diſpoſed by this loue, to preferre the glory of God before any intereſt of our owne in vnlawfull obiects, yet if we reflect vpon the paines of hell, we shall finde, that we are more eaſily carried to deteſt and feare them, then ſinne; which is a ſigne, that the loue of God aboue all thinges, is not yet ſo ſtrong in vs, as our inclination to loue our ſelues. Howſoeuer, this degree of the loue of God aboue all thinges, is ſufficient for attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe it is greater in vs then the actuall loue of any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull obiect, and ſo it is of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient force, to make vs forbeare to offend God by mortall ſinne.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes alſo the principall ground of our attrition may be the feare of hell, the ioyes of
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:63100:219"/> heauen, the enormity of ſinne, reflecting vpon them with the eye of our owne intereſt; for theſe motiues alſo are ſufficient to withdraw vs from ſinne, whereby we know we shall be depriued of heauen, and incurre the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting paines of hell. Howſoeuer, although (as I ſay) theſe may be the principall grounds of attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe they may be ſo ſtrong as to make vs to deteſt ſinne for our owne intereſt, and although they be of their owne nature good and laudable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do for the moſt part prepare the way to loue; yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they do bring with them, ſome degree of the loue of God, which is a beginning of louing him, they would not be ſufficient for true attrition. And the reaſon of it is, becauſe if they be not oyned with ſome kinde of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:63100:219"/> to loue God, though imperfectly, they do not actually conuert vs to God at all, but only to ourſelues. And ſo they cannot diſpoſe vs ſufficiently to receiue iuſtifying grace; becauſe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are expelled by contrary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and therefore whereas ſinne is a motion auerting vs from God, and conuerting vs to creatures, iuſtification muſt proceed from a contrary motion, which muſt auert vs from creatures, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting vs againe to God. And ſo we ſee that the Councell of Trent, ſpeaking of Attrition, doth ioyne with the feare of hell, (whereby we are moued to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to ſinne,) the hope of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, by which we are conuerted to God; for this hope bringeth alwayes with it a beginning of the loue of God. For there is this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt hope of pardon
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:63100:220"/> from man, and hope of pardon from God, that we may haue ſome ground to expect pardon from man, whom we haue offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, without any reaſon that may moue vs to loue him; in regard, that although he doth not loue vs, yet we may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fident he will pardon vs not for any good he wisheth to vs, but for his owne intereſt, either becauſe we are vſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to him, or out of vaine glory, or for feare of harme that may happen vnto himſelfe, if he doth not pardon vs, or the like, which are not motiues fit to make vs loue him againe. But when we hope for pardon from God, our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence doth reſt meerely vpon his goodneſſe; for God doth neuer pardon vs, but by louing vs, and nothing but his owne mercy and goodneſſe can moue him to pardon vs: he gaineth
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:63100:220"/> nothing by vs, and hath no neede of vs; neither are our deſerts any at all, and to rely vpon them, were not hope, but damnable preſumption: ſo that the hope of our pardon from God, is raiſed by the conſideration of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe only, which alwayes brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth loue with it. For how can any man ground a confidence meerely vpon God, as the Author of all goodneſſe, the proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of loue, without louing him in whom he apprehendeth that goodneſſe? And this is confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable alſo to the doctrine of the Councell of Trent, concerning the diſpoſition, which is required precedently to iuſtification by the Sacrament of Baptiſme, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered Seſſ. 6. c. 6. <hi>Thoſe who are ſinners, when they vnderſtand themſelues to be ſuch, by conuerting themſelues from the feare of diuine
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:63100:221"/> iuſtice, wherewith they are profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably ſtrucken, to the conſideration of God his mercie, they are erected into hope, confiding that God will be propitious vnto them for Chriſt his ſake, and they begin to loue him as the fountaine of all iuſtice: and therefore are moued againſt ſinne by a certaine hatred and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, that is, by that pennance which ought to be done before Baptiſme.</hi> So that true attrition doth alwayes include the loue of God. And of this feare of hell, ioyned with the hope of pardon, the ſame Councell teacheth vs, that it is a gift of God, and a motion of the holy Ghoſt; for no man can loue God, as he ought to do, but he whom God firſt loueth, and moueth by his holy grace.</p>
                     <p>Now ſome are of opinion, that it is not ſufficient, that this loue
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:63100:221"/> be the loue of God meerely for our owne intereſt, but that it ought to be the loue of God aboue all thinges for his owne ſake onely, though it be as yet but a weake and imperfect loue in that kinde. And they are moued thereunto for theſe reaſons; firſt, becauſe the loue of God for our owne intereſt, doth not properly conuert vs to God, but to our ſelues only; for the end of our loue is only that which moueth vs. Secondly, becauſe the end of true attrition is, to breed in vs the perfect loue of God, and ſo it muſt be ioyned at leaſt with ſome beginning of it, which may by little and little encreaſe, and bring vs to perfection, according to the meaſure of God his grace working in vs afterwards. Laſtly, becauſe the loue which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of vs, and which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:63100:222"/> due to him, and without which we cannot obſerue God his comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dements, is that loue, whereby we do preferre him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all created thinges, and do embrace him as our laſt end; and therefore, when we haue loſt God his grace, we cannot recouer it againe, vnleſſe we begin with obſeruing this precept, which is the ground of all; for this is the firſt thing that God exacteth at our handes, and that giueth vs ſtrength to doe all the reſt: but if we loue God for our owne intereſt only, we make our owne happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which (as it is limited within ourſelues) is a created and finite thing, to be our laſt end; and ſo we looke vpon God only as a meanes to attaine to this end. For theſe reaſons this opinion is very probable, and therefore the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureſt way is to attend to thoſe
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:63100:222"/> conſiderations, which chiefly moue vs to loue God aboue all thinges, and ſo to ſtirre our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vp to hate ſinne vpon the ſame motiue.</p>
                     <p>This doctrine may ſeeme hard to ſome, who thinke that we cannot loue God aboue all thinges, vnleſſe the habit or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from whence this act pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth, be ſtronger, and more intenſe in vs, then our inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to loue ourſelues: but they are miſtaken, for we may haue this act, though the motion from whence it proceedeth, be not ſo ſtrong, as thoſe euill habits in vs, which incline vs to vice and ſinne. For when we recollect ourſelues, and conſider the infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, our reaſon doth preſently dictate vnto vs, that we ought to preferre him before all thinges for his owne ſake only;
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:63100:223"/> and our will (if it be not preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted with ſome contrary obiect) doth by God his grace eaſily follow the dictamen of reaſon, and affect him, as ſuch, which is, to loue him aboue all thinges; and there is no Idiot ſo ſimple, who being inſtructed, is not capable of this loue, as well as he is of the feare of hell: and yet if afterwards we should be tempted with our owne intereſt in ſome vnlawfull obiect, we are eaſily ouercome; which is a ſigne, that, although we did truly loue God aboue all thinges, yet the ſource, that is, the habit or motion from whence that loue proceeded, was not ſo ſtrong, nor ſo firmely rooted in vs, as our euill habits are, which incline vs to ſinne. I do not ſay, that all ſuch acts of loue are ſufficient euen for attrition; for Granada that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man of the Order of S. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicke,
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:63100:223"/> and others affirme very well, that how great this attrition or ſorrow of minde for ſinne (which encreaſeth according to the meaſure of our loue) ought to be, that it may attaine to the degree of perfect attrition, it is not granted to any mortall man to know; but the knowledge thereof belongeth only to that Lord, from whom nothing can be hidden. Beſides, ſuch acts of loue are many times ineffica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, whereas it is certaine, that true attrition ought to be an effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious and abſolute repentance.</p>

                     <p>Yes, ſuppoſing it be perfect at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition. But leaſt ſome should miſtake in this ſacramentall attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:63100:224"/> they are to know, that theſe conditions are required to make it ſuch. Firſt, it muſt be a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall act of God his grace, proceeding from ſome ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall motiue, grounded vpon faith. Secondly, it muſt expell from vs <hi>voluntatem peccandi,</hi> that is, it muſt be ſuch a voluntary free deteſtation of ſinne, and ſorrow to haue committed it, as doth bring with it a firme purpoſe of endeauouring to auoid ſinne, aboue all euills that can befall vs in this world. Thirdly, it muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude an humble and reſigned reſolution, to vndergoe ſuch deſerued penna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for our ſinnes, as it shall pleaſe God to inflict vpon vs in this world, or in the next; as alſo a purpoſe to do worthy fruits of repentance in this life, and to performe that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall ſatisfaction, which the
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:63100:224"/> Prieſt shall impoſe vpon vs in confeſſion. Fourthly, it muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a firme reſolution, in caſes of wrong done to our neighbour, to make him reſtitution. Fifthly, it muſt be ioyned with the hope of pardon, and confidence in God his mercy, that he will be propitious vnto vs for Chriſt his ſake, through the merits of his ſacred paſſion. Laſtly, it muſt be accompanied with the loue of God, either for our owne intereſt, or (according to the more ſecure opinion) for his owne ſake: that is, we muſt begin to loue him purely for himſelfe aboue all thinges; whereby we are alſo moued to repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and ſorrow, for hauing offended him, who is our laſt end, and whoſe bleſſed will, as the Author of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, we ought to preferre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the world. If any of theſe
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:63100:225"/> conditions be wanting, it will not be perfect attrition, but imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and ſuch as being ioyned with the Sacrament of Pennance, will not ſuffice for iuſtification.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe none but God himſelfe doth know whether we haue theſe ſupernaturall acts of ſorrow, and the loue of God, or no; and how great and intenſe this ſorrow of minde ought to be, that it may attaine the degree of perfect attrition; therefore it is a moſt commendable thing, that ſometimes we should make ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall confeſſions, as ſome doe yearely; that thereby laying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eies the number of our offences and grieuous ſinnes, and by helpe of ſpirituall exerciſes, we may be moued to a more ſtrong repentance, and ſupply the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, if there had been any for want of perfect attrition in our
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:63100:225"/> former confeſſions. Howſoeuer when we haue done our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour, and finde a ſorrow for the paſt, and a firme purpoſe of amendement for the future, with a deſire to loue God aboue all thinges, we ought not to be ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous in ſearching the motiue and meaſure of this ſorrow, but we muſt remit the reſt to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull goodneſſe of God, and goe with confidence and humility to the Prieſt to receiue abſolution, though our ſinnes be neuer ſo greate; hoping that by vertue of the Sacrament of Pennance, allmighty God will ſtrengthen our hearts with his diuine loue, and ſupply the defects and weakenſſe of contrition in vs, by accepting our deſire thereof.</p>
                     <p>And here alſo is to be obſerued, as well touching contrition, as attrition, that ſome thinke they
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:63100:226"/> haue no loue towards God, not ſorrow for their ſinnes, vnleſſe their affections be accompanied with ſenſible paſſion: but they are exceedingly deceiued, for this loue and griefe is purely ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, it is not ſeated in the ſenſes, but in the will of man, and it is ſo much the greater, when diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing with our ſenſible mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and perſiſting only within the ſphere of reaſon, it ouerco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the contradiction of ſenſe. And therefore the loue and griefe, which we feele for worldly thinges, is oftentimes accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a certaine tenderneſſe of heart, and is more ſenſible to vs, then the ſorrow for our ſinnes, or the loue of God; and yet the loue of God, and the ſorrow for our ſinnes is more intenſe in the reaſonable part of man, which is his iudgement and his will. For
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:63100:226"/> the motiues of loue and griefe in contrition, are not corporall thinges, not obiects fit to moue our ſenſe, but they are ſpirituall thinges, and obiects that ſtrike only vpon our reaſon, as the goodneſſe of God, the guilt of ſinne in our ſoule, and the like, which are not thinges preſent to our ſenſe at all; and ſo it is no wonder, if for the moſt part they make no impreſſion in our ſenſes, but only in our reaſon: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the true ballance to weigh our contrition, is not our ſenſes, but it is our reaſon, built vpon the foundation of faith, which may be ſtrongly moued, though our ſenſe hath no feeling of it at all.</p>

                     <p>Becauſe it is commanded by Chriſt to be vſed. And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences of it are great; firſt, it is the moſt naturall eaſement of ſinne, for we ſee by experience, that when one hath committed any foule fact ſecretly, it loadeth his heart vntill he hath broken his minde to ſome one or other.

                     <p>It is a voluntary, accuſation, made by à penitent of the ſinnes he hath committed himſelfe, to a Prieſt capable to abſolue him, accompanied with griefe for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing committed them, and with a firme purpoſe not to commit

By the word, <hi>voluntary,</hi> we are taught that a confeſſion made by conſtraint, ſuch as criminalls make before iudges by force of torment, is of no value; for God aboue all thinges ſeeketh the will of man. By the word, <hi>Accuſation,</hi> we are taught, that we muſt ſay determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, that we haue done ſuch and ſuch a thing, and not as ſome vſe to ſay, if I haue offended God in ſuch or ſuch a kinde of ſinne, I accuſe my ſelfe of it: for he is not eſteemed to accuſe himſelfe of a fault, who confeſſeth it with an <hi>if,</hi> when he is certaine he hath committed it.

                     <p>Since that its ſignification doth conſiſt in teſtifying the ſincerity of our inward repentance, and an
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:63100:238"/> acknowledgement of our obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to do worthy fruits of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in this life; I gather firſt, that when we haue performed the pennance impoſed by the Prieſt, we ought not therefore to deſiſt, but we muſt ſtill go on, in bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling our ſinnes all our life time; for as S.

<pb n="470" facs="tcp:63100:239"/> no proportion with the grieuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſinnes, whereof the Penitent is guiltie, that then the Penitent by doing that ſmall pennance, muſt not thinke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe releaſed of the debt he oweth for his ſinnes, nor acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the obligation he hath to doe worthy fruits of repentance, but he muſt do them voluntarily, or by the aduiſe of his Ghoſtly father, which will be more meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious.</p>

                  <div n="37" type="question">

                     <p>Yes; for as by the Sacrament of Baptiſme, we do ſolemnly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the world, and promiſe to abſtaine from ſinne, ſo we do by the Sacrament of pennance (which is a ſecond Baptiſme, and called by the Fathers a laborious Baptiſme) not only renew our former promiſe made in Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:63100:239"/> but alſo we do adde a new purpoſe (ſignified by the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance impoſed by the Prieſt, and accepted by the Penitent) of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing by worthy fruits of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, the harme which we haue ſuffered by ſinne. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Councell of Trent tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, that in the pennance for ſinnes committed after Baptiſme, is contained, not only a ceſſation from ſinne, a deteſtation of ſinne, and a contrite and humble heart, which thinges are required in Baptiſme; but alſo ſatisfaction by faſting, almes, praier, and other pious exerciſes of a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life.</p>

                     <head>38. From whence ariſeth the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of worthy fruits of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?</head>
                     <p>It ariſeth from two heads; firſt from the precept, for they are expreſſely commanded by God.
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:63100:240"/> Secondly, from the nature of the thing it ſelfe; for the light of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon doth teach vs, that we are bound both to ſatisfy God his iuſtice, and alſo to repaire our owne loſſes when we are able; the one being a kinde of reſtitution to be made to God, and the other a kinde of reſtitution due to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Wherefore to know how farre this precept of doing worthy fruits of repentance bindeth, we muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider theſe two principall ends, for which they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
                     <p>And as for the firſt end, which is to ſatisfy God his iuſtice for the temporall paine remaining after that the guilt of ſinne is remitted, you muſt note, that the Miniſter of God cannot know how much repentance and contrition the Penitent hath; nether can the Penitent nor the Miniſter know
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:63100:240"/> the value of the ſayd contrition, nor how much more he ought to do for due ſatisfaction; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the primitiue Church, they vſed to impoſe auſtere pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances for euery mortall ſinne, which they were to performe for a long time together, yea for ſome ſinnes they were to do pennance all their life time, that ſo God his iuſtice might be more fully ſatisfied: but in after ages, the Church hath mitigated that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer auſterity, releaſing the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiall Canons by frequent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, which she granteth from time to time for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall good of the Church; which Indulgences vpon ſuch occaſions do likewiſe remit the paine due to ſinne, being granted by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the keies of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore it is certaine that
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:63100:241"/> we are not for the preſent obliged to the Penitentiall Canons, but it ſufficeth, if the Prieſt impoſe ſuch pennances as haue ſome propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in chaſtiſing the ſinner, with as much paine and affliction, as he tooke vnlawfull delight and content in his vnbridled paſſions, by ſinfull actions; which alſo may be prudently moderated vpon iuſt occaſions, by remitting the Penitent for the reſt, to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall faſts and mortifications obſerued in the Church, and to ſuch voluntarie afflictions, as he himſelfe shall make choiſe of.</p>
                     <p>In which kinde it is to be noted, that euery one is bound to vſe vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily ſuch pennances, as he findeth neceſſary to keepe the ſpirit of compunctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his heart, and to preſerue him from danger of falling into a contempt of God his wrath,
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:63100:241"/> and of reparation due to his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. And therefore although it be true, that we are not bound now to the actuall practiſe of the Penitentiall Canons, yet we are obliged to be ſo prepared and diſpoſed in minde, as to be ready to vndergoe them, in caſe they were abſolutely neceſſary to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the diuine iuſtice, or that they were enioyned vs by the Church.</p>
                     <p>From whence it followeth, that although thoſe ſinners, who haue not leiſure to do worthy fruits of repentance, becauſe they are ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed by death preſently after their conuerſion, shall be purged by the paines of Purgatorie, and ſo be ſaued; as alſo thoſe shall be, who haue had leiſure to do worthy fruits of repentance, but haue performed them ſlackely and negligently: yet thoſe who
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:63100:242"/> neuer had an intention to do worthy fruits of repentance in this life, or, if they had ſuch an intention, did afterwardes, when they had leiſure, totally neglect to do them, will not finde a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie in the next world, but eternall punishment in hell, for their contempt of God his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, in not performing that, which his iuſtice exacteth from vs in this life.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond end for which the worthy fruits of repentance were commanded by God, is medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: and ſatisfaction as it hath relation to this end, is defined thus; <hi>Eſt cauſas peccatorum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcindere, &amp; earum ſuggeſtionibus aditum non indulgere; Satisfaction of pennance, is to cut away the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of ſinne, and to giue no entrance to their ſuggeſtions.</hi> Where you muſt obſerue, that
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:63100:242"/> there is this difference in ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, as it hath relation to theſe two ends, that in reſpect of the former end of ſatisfying for the temporall paine, it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed by indulgences of the Church; and one member of the Church may alſo ſatisfy for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but the workes of ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, as it is a medicine, cannot be diſpenſed with by any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church, nor can one man performe them for another, but euery man is bound to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them himſelfe, otherwiſe they will be of no value for that end. And therefore the Councel of Trent doth ſeriouſly admonish all Prieſts, that they should not winke at the ſinnes of their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents, by enioyning ſmall pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances for great ſinnes, leaſt that thereby they themſelues become partakers of other mens ſinnes.</p>
                     <pb n="478" facs="tcp:63100:243"/>
                     <p>Now you muſt know, that the immediate occaſions of ſinne, which we are bound to cut of, are of three ſortes: ſome are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, and outward to vs, and conſequently ſuch, as we may readily ſeparate our ſelues from; as for example, the hanting of ſuch or ſuch perſons, the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting of ſuch places, the doing of ſuch actions, the vndertaking of ſuch employme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, and the like, whereby we are vſually drawne into any mortall ſinne of what ſort ſoeuer, as of enuy, detraction, conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion, ſedition, faction, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, lechery, or any other; all which occaſions are readily cut of by auoiding the ſayd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, places, actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, employments, &amp;c. Other occaſions are within ourſelues, which, although we do carry them about vs, yet are ſuch, as we may in time totally
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:63100:243"/> free ourſelues from; and theſe are the reliques of actuall ſinne, that is, the peruerſe habits, and ſtiffe inclinations to ſinne, which the cuſtome of ſinning leaueth in vs, which habits we are bound to endeauour to roote out by the worthy fruits of repentance, that ſo we may reſtore ourſelues to the former ſtate we were in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſinned. The third ſort of occaſions are alſo within our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and ſuch as will beare vs company to our graues, becauſe we can neuer totally ſeparate our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from them; and theſe are the inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s co ſeuerall ſinnes, proceeding from the naturall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of our bodies, ioyned to the generall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupiſcence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with all mankinde is infected by originall ſinne. And although we are not able to ſeparate our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues totally from theſe peruerſe
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:63100:244"/> inclinations of nature, yet we may abate them ſo, as to take away all immediate danger of being drawne by them into mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſinne: and this we are bound to do, eſpecially hauing found by experience, in ſinning actually after Baptiſme, our owne weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and hauing diſcouered in particular, thoſe inclinations, by which the Diuell, and our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence do draw vs into ſinne. And becauſe this ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be done, but by doing worthy fruits of repentance, therefore we are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to do them, that thereby we may cut of all as well inward as outward immediate occaſions of ſinne. In ſo much, that it is to be feared of thoſe, who neglect to do this, that either they neuer had that contrition, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Sacrament of pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; or if they had it, that it is
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:63100:244"/> decayed in them; for true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance sheweth it ſelfe in effects, and as the Apoſtle ſayeth, <hi>it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſtedfaſt pennance to ſaluation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nether muſt any man, who hath vſed the auſterity of pennance for ſome time, thinke himſelfe afterwards ſecure, as if he had no need any longer to do worthy fruits of repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance: for this is the ſinne of pride, the moſt odious ſinne of any in the ſight of God, for the cure whereof he doth ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times permit ſuch perſons, to fall into ſome palpable groſſe ſinne. Wherefore the fruits of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſo farre forth as they are medecinall, are alwayes neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and muſt neuer be layed aſide in this world; for, that originall concupiſcence, which drew vs into the firſt relapſe after Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, and can neuer be rooted out in this life, ought to render vs
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:63100:245"/> wary all our life time, and to teach vs after a wound to take more heed, and to worke our ſaluation with feare and trembling. <hi>For</hi> (to vſe the wordes of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Trent) <hi>ſince that we know, that we are not as yet regenerated into glory, but only into the hope of glory, we ought to ſtand in feare of that ſtrife, which yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in vs, with the flesh, the world, and the Diuell.</hi>

                     <p>You muſt obſerue, that pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is done two wayes; the one inward, conſiſting in the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heart; the other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, conſiſting in the affliction of the flesh: when we do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne and reproue our ſinne, then we haue repentance; when we do by enſuing ſatisfaction pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, and correct our ſinne, then we begin to do the worthy fruits
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:63100:245"/> of repentance; and when our paine in punishing, and our dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in correcting ſinne, is no leſſe, then our pleaſure was in doing the ſinne, and our care in purſuing it, then we do accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish the worthy fruits of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. As for example, if one hath ſtolne other mens goods, beſides the ceaſing from ſinne, and the reſtitution of the ſame goods, let him begin to giue his owne: if he hath vſed fornication a long time, let him chaſtiſe his flesh as long time: if he hath done iniury to any man in word or deed, let him not only make amends with humble and good words, but let him labour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile his enemies with kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and benefits.

                     <p>Although all good workes in generall do helpe to both theſe
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:63100:246"/> ends; yet you muſt note, that thoſe workes are moſt proper to ſatisfy for the paine, which are in themſelues painefull, and do chaſtiſe the flesh; whereas thoſe are moſt proper to cure the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed humours left by ſinfull ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, which are ioyned with the practiſe of their contrary vertues. Howſoeuer there be three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall workes of ſatisfaction, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in the Ghoſpel for both theſe ends, which are faſting, praier, and almeſdeeds. Faſting is a medicine to heale per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly thoſe ſinnes, which we haue done by concupiſcence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the flesh, againſt ourſelues, and our owne bodies. Humble and deuout praier, and eſpecially dayly meditation, of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour his Paſſion, is a medecine to heale perfectly the pride of life, the contempt of godlineſſe, and
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:63100:247"/> preſumption of minde, which are ſinnes immediately againſt God. The giuing of almes is a mede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine to heale perfectly thoſe ſinnes, which are committed by couetouſneſſe, deceipt, oppreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and vniuſt dealing againſt our neighbour. Now the Scripture ioyneth for the moſt part theſe three together; becauſe one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other two is of little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue; for faſting without lifting vp our minde to God by praier, and without mercy to a mans neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is little regarded by God; and his praier, who will not bridle the deſires of his flesh, or shutteth vp his mercy from his neighbour that needeth it, is not heard by God; no more are almes meritorious, if they want the fellowship of praier, or be ioyned with ſurfeiting on the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the world: but when all
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:63100:247"/> three are ioyned together, they are of great force, to appeaſe the wrath of God, and to purge our ſoules from all filthineſſe.</p>
                     <p>And here it is to be noted, that vnder faſting are contained all bodily paines and labours, as watching, lying vpon the ground, vſing of hairecloth, diſciplines, and the like, which ought not to be vſed, but with diſcretion, and by aduiſe of Ghoſtly fathers, that they may correct, but not deſtroy the body. Vnder praier are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the praiers of others, as of Prieſts, poore Schollers, poore men, and ſuch as by our libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity are procured to pray for vs. Vnder almes are contained all the workes of mercy as well cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, as ſpirituall, all which are of great value, it being vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly the moſt efficacious meanes to obtaine mercy at God his

The firſt, is done partly, and chiefly in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, by ceremonies, and maieſty of holy rites, at which ſenſible
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:63100:253"/> men ſtanding in admiration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to thinke there is ſome grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter myſtery included, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to learne and vnderſtand it: the ſecond, is done chiefly by the holy Sacraments, and by cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing, by which the people vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what is to be belieued, hoped, and put in practiſe, and are enabled to performe it: the third, is done by gouernment and preaching, by which men are ſet forward, and kept in order, to do what they haue vnderſtood, ought to be done. Now accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to theſe three functions, the Eccleſiaſticall Hierarchy is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, of Bishops, Prieſts, and Miniſters; and it is called Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, that is, holy principality.</p>

                  <p>The third, which is to gouerne and preach, for gouernment is
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:63100:254"/> of greateſt difficulty, and moſt neceſſary, ſeeing that it attendeth to make vs do, what we know. Now both the difficulty and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of doing is farre greater, then of knowing; for the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is greater after knowledge, and the difficulty of doing no leſſe: ſo that to make vs do, is the proper effect of the holy Ghoſt; and the field where nature and grace vſe their ſtratagemes, and fight their pitched battaile. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment therefore, by which we are ſet on to do what we know, belongeth chiefly and properly to Bishops, from whom all infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Prieſts, as well as the people, are to take their rule and direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And Chriſt to the end that their gouernment might be more authorized, hath reſerued to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and to their character, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Confirmation, whereby
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:63100:254"/> we become perfect Chriſtians, by receiuing the manlike ſtrength, and growth of charity; and alſo the Sacrament of Order, by which authority is giuen to others to be gouerners. Beſides in regard of their gouernment, Chriſt hath giuen to them iuriſdiction in a more eminent degree; then to other Prieſts; that is, an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to excommunicate all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and notorious ſinners, who being called to iudgement, refuſe to come, or if they come, refuſe to obey the ſentence of their iudge. Which excommunication is not inflicted to deſtroy them, but as a medecine to correct them, that thereby they may be ashamed of their fault, and ſeeing themſelues depriued of the participation of Chriſt his merits giuen by the Sacraments, and of the merits of the Church,
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:63100:255"/> they may be moued to amend their liues, and to returne to liue amongſt Chriſtian people, like Chriſtian men. And as the Bishop hath power to excommunicate ſuch perſons, ſo alſo hath he power to abſolue them againe from excommunication, when they are penitent, and obedient. So that theſe functions belong properly to Bishops, to gouerne in chiefe; to chaſtiſe the wicked and diſobedient, by excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating them; to preach and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort; to adminiſter the Sacrament of Confirmation; and to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Sacrament of Order.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond, that is to inſtruct, and adminiſter the Sacraments: to them alſo it belongeth to aſſiſt the Bishop, and to gouerne vnder him, and to preach by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:63100:255"/> from him. And Chriſt by reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to them the function of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing and the adminiſtration of diuerſe Sacraments, hath dignified alſo their perſons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is neceſſary for their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that they be reſpected by the people. So that the functions of Prieſts are chiefly theſe, to aſſiſt the Bishop in gouerning, and preaching by commiſſion from him, to offer vp to God the holy ſacrifice of Maſſe, and to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter all Sacraments, excepting Confirmation and Order. And from hence we may gather what reſpect is due to Prieſts; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely, if we owe reſpect to thoſe who beare temporall offices in the common wealth, we owe a farre greater reſpect to them, whoſe perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s Chriſt himſelfe hath dignified with the greateſt and higheſts functions that are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed

                  <head>9. Why are not Bishops reckoned amongſt the reſt?</head>
                  <p>If you reckon Epiſcopacy, and adde it to the reſt, then indeed they are in all eight Orders: but commonly it is not named with the reſt, for two reaſons: firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is an emine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t degree which ſurpaſſeth them all; as being the ſource from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce all the reſt are deriued; for they all proceed from it, and end in it; and ſo as in a kingdome, the king is not reckoned in the number of the officers that gouerne vnder him becauſe his power is tranſcende<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and runneth through all the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrats of the kingdome; no more is the Bishop reckoned ordinarily in the number of the other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:63100:257"/> for he is in his church as the king in his kingdome, the prince and head of all Eccleſiaſticall hierarchy or holy principality. The ſecond reaſon is, becauſe if we take prieſthood in its full la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, Epiſcopacy is alſo inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in it; for the name and office of prieſthood, doth ſignify two thinges, the firſt is ordinary au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or iuriſdiction, to gouerne men in order to ſaluation, and to God his ſeruice; the ſecond is power to offer Sacrifice to God; which two functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are expreſſed by two words or names appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated commonly to Prieſts, to wit <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and <hi>Sacerdos;</hi> for <hi>Presbyter</hi> and <hi>Presbyteriu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> which is a Greek word, do import a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority and power of gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as <hi>Senior</hi> and <hi>Senatus</hi> do in Latine: <hi>Sacerdos</hi> and <hi>Sacerdotium</hi> haue relation to ſacrifice, and
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:63100:258"/> they come from <hi>Sacer</hi> or <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crare,</hi> which is to make holy, and ſo they import power to offer vp ſacrifice, which is a holy and ſacred function. Now then from-hence it followeth that the order of prieſthood is twofold; the one being only of inferiour Prieſts, who are thoſe whom we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call Prieſts, to whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to Sacrifice, but not to gouerne in chiefe; the other of ſuperiour and chiefe Prieſts, who are only Bishops; to whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not only to Sacrifice, but alſo to gouerne in chiefe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing that prieſthood, doth ſignify theſe two functions, and that the firſt which is to gouerne in chiefe, by ordinary authority conferred vpon men by Chriſt himſelfe, is the more principall, abſolutely ſpeaking, (though in ſome reſpect the other may be
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:63100:258"/> preferred) as being that by which the ſecond is directed and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and belongeth only to Epiſcopacy, it followeth, that Epiſcopacy is included vnder the name of prieſthood.</p>

                  <p>They be very many, and very great ones: firſt it obteineth vs remiſſion of ſinne, and God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth it for ſatisfaction of the paine remaining due to ſinnes after that the guilt is remitted. Secondly, it encreaſeth our hope and confidence in God, for it is certaine, that he who hath fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent acceſſe to any perſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh more familiar and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent with him. Thirdly, it enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth charity, for it is impoſſible to conuerſe often with God, who is all fire of loue, without recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſome heate from his ſacred flames. Fourthly, it encreaſeth humility and feare, for how can one be continually asking, and humbling himſelfe like a begger, but that he muſt needs perceiue his owne pouerty, and ſtand in
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:63100:271"/> feare of offending him, of whom he hath continuall need. Fifthly, it produceth a contempt of the world, and a delight in ſpirituall and celeſtiall thinges. Sixthly, to omit many others, it maketh one honoured and reſpected by the Angells themſelues, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chooſe but beare reuerence to him, whom they ſee familiar with God himſelfe.</p>

                  <p>The be ſeuen. The firſt is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, that we demand nothing but ſuch thinges, as are either neceſſary, or conducing to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſaluation; for it is certaine, that he who demandeth thinges that are vnprofitable, or hurtfull to his ſoule, deſerueth not to be heard, but to be chaſtiſed. The ſecond is faith, that we do firmely
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:63100:271"/> belieue that God, to whom we addreſſe our praiers, is good, and able to grant what we demand. The third is hope, by which we do confide in God his goodneſſe, that he will grant what we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. The fourth, is charity, that is, that we be in the ſtate of grace, or at leaſt that we haue a hearty deſire of repentance and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The fifth is humility, for it it moſt reaſonable, that he who is a begger, should humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe before him, from whom he deſireth reliefe, and that he should relie meerely vpon his goodneſſe, and not vpon his owne merit. The ſixth is deuotion, for it is not enough to aske with his lipps, but he muſt aske from his heart, with care and ſolicitude, and with an ardent deſire to obteine what he asketh. The ſeuenth is perſeuerance, for God
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:63100:272"/> will not haue vs to aske once only, but oftentimes, that ſo triall may be made of our conſtancy.</p>

                  <p>We haue ſayd already, that the moſt perfect kinde of praier, is to pray by ſuffering, and the next to that is praying by action; for both theſe do include praying by thought. But becauſe we can ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely pray either of theſe wayes, as we ought to do, vnleſſe we be firſt well prepared, and diſpoſed to performe them with deuotion, which preparation or diſpoſition is chiefly got by that kinde of praying by thought, which is commonly called mentall praier, or meditation, it followeth that
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:63100:274"/> mentall praier or meditation is ordinarily the moſt neceſſary, to thoſe who are able to meditate.</p>

                  <head>2. How are we prepared by mentall praier to pray by action and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring?</head>
                  <p>You muſt know, that a vertuous life is a continuall praier, which life doth conſiſt in doing good with charitie, and in ſuffering euill with patience: now mentall praier is the conſideration of thinges neceſſary to thoſe ends, and not a drie conſideration, but a mouing of our will out of it, that thereby we may exerciſe our affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s towards God allmighty; which exerciſe of our affections is the only thing that giueth life to our actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and ſufferings: for how do you thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke we come to practiſe a vertuous life, but by our affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?

                  <head>3. How many partes be there of mentall praier.</head>
                  <p>They are three, the firſt is to know, and to be ſure of the truth, you are to conſider; and this rather belongeth to him, who preſcribeth the meditation in our preſent purpoſe; for it belongeth
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:63100:275"/> to him to giue a ſtrong and plaine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration, that he who cometh to praier, need not much adoe to be conuinced of the truth. The next part is the making of a reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> according to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge propoſed, by exhorting himſelfe out of the weightineſſe of the conſideration, to rectify his will and inclinations: and this is properly that which is called Meditation; for <hi>Meditari</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth to often thinke of, or to conne, or exerciſe ſomethi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g. The third part is the turning our heart to God, for whoſe ſake we are to do all thinges, and from whom we are to expect the encreaſe of our labours. For as all the huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans labour, is to little purpoſe, vnleſſe God ſends raine, heare, and faire weather at due ſeaſons: ſo likewiſe vnleſſe God direct our life, it is to little purpoſe

                  <p>Vocall praier hath two excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences aboue mentall: the firſt is, that ordinarily the praier is made by ſome, who haue more skill then we haue, and therefore is more perfect for the moſt part, then one of our mentall praiers. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, it keepeth from diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions much; becauſe our eyes, and (when we ſay them without bookes) our memories hold our vnderſtanding to the matter, better then when we haue no ſuch determination. But likewiſe on the other ſide, it hath two diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages: one, that it doth not ſo well fill our ſoules, being nether ſo much laboured, as what we make our ſelues; nor ſo naturally
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:63100:276"/> proportioned to vs, as what we do our ſelues. Secondly the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions conceiued by vocall praier do not moue vs to action ſo ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as thoſe which proceed from meditation.

Which kinde of praier hath alwayes been

                  <head>5. What obligation haue we to pray to Angells and Saints?</head>
                  <p>To anſwer your queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you muſt know, that Angells and Saints are in perfect bliſſe and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whether we pray to them or no; from whence you will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that all ſeruice and honour done to Saints by vs, redoundeth rather to our owne profit then to
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:63100:279"/> theirs. And therefore although honour in it ſelfe be due vnto them, yet they are then beſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, when we ourſelues do profit by it, and grow better by honouring them; for this is euen to them an increaſe of an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall kinde of glory. From-whence it followeth, that the keeping of holy dayes, building churches, and ſetting vp altars to God in memorie of Saints, is to be moderated according to the vtility, which redoundeth to the Church by it: and in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the praiers, or what ſort of deuotions ſoeuer are vſed in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate to their honours, are to be gouerned by the ſame principle. Now the vtility redounding to the Church is, firſt that whereas humane nature is eaſily weary of being carried aboue it ſelfe by praier, and other ſpirituall exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes,
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:63100:280"/> the wearineſſe of deuotion is in part holpen by this holy va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety. Secondly, the memory of God his goodneſſe and benefits towards mankinde, is made fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar vnto vs by making often commemoration of his Saints, vpon who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he beſtowed his graces moſt plentifully, and who were many times the inſtruments he vſed to conferre many ſingular benefits vpon his whole Church. Againe, whereas mens humours and ſtates of life be ſo diuerſe, it happeneth out, that euery man may haue examples in their owne kinde to be affected vnto; and many times this maketh a greater profit by ſuch an affinity to their owne condition, then by a great deake of preaching or good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. And ſo you may ſee what obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation there is to honour Saints, and to pray vnto them; towit,
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:63100:280"/> when the Church for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon good of her children preſſeth it, then that is to be done, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer she commandeth, and it is a ſinne to omit it. But in other occaſions, and at other times, euery particular man as farre as he findeth need or helpe by this variety in his priuate deuotion, ſo farre he doth very well to follow it, eſpecially if he findeth that it ſtirreth vp a failing deuotion in him; for the end of this, as of all all other pious exercices, muſt be God himſelfe, and the better performing of our duty towards him.</p>

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, when a man ſaith his praiers before a picture of our Sauiour, or of any Saint, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing himſelfe vnto it, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth thereby a great apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Saint, as if he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe were preſent, vnto whom he praieth, and by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce praieth with a greater reſpect and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thirdly, it ſerueth for an addreſſe of the praier, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he vſe any corporall geſtures withall: for as the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:63100:281"/> Chriſtians were vſed to turne themſelues to the Eaſt, and the Iewes towards the Temple, when they would adore God, the Eaſt and Temple ſeruing for a determination of their action: ſo much more when I bow, or do any other reuerence, or pray be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a picture, it is a determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my praier or reſpect vnto God, or vnto that Saint, whoſe picture it is. Laſtly, it is a helpe to him that praieth, for pictures beare with them an expreſſion oftentimes, which would coſt many words, and workes of our memory. As he who looketh on a crucifixe, if he deſire to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to himſelfe, and fixe in his heart the wounds and paſſion of our bleſſed Sauiour, he may finde a great facility and quickeneſſe to do it, by hauing the picture before his eyes.</p>

                  <p>As for hanging lampes before pictures of Saints, it is to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent their glory in heauen, or the burning charity with which they were endued here on earth, and ſo theſe and ſuch like expreſſions are apt to breed a greater appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion in men, which is a meanes to make them pray the better, and conſequently obteine more at God his hands, and therefore are allowed, and recommended in the Catholike Church.</p>

Howſoeuer ſince that one principall effect of the Sacrifice, is to diſpoſe vs to grace by appeaſing the wrath of God, and by obtaining ſuch helpes, as may worke iuſtifying grace in vs in due time, with true repentance for our ſinnes, as the Councell of Trent doth teach vs; and ſince that this effect is wrought <hi>ex opere operato</hi> (as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines terme it) in thoſe, who heare Maſſe with deuotion, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely if one be in mortall ſinne, and reflect vpon it, and should not at leaſt endeauour to ſtirre vp

                  <p>So that it cannot be denyed, but that whoſoeuer doth heare Maſſe with a poſitiue reſolution to perſiſt in ſinne, doth beſides the irreuerence co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted againſt the higheſt myſterie in Chriſtian Religion, render himſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of thoſe ſpeciall benefits, which are obteined by this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.
